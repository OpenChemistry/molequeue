/**
 * @class JsonRpc jsonrpc.h <molequeue/servercore/jsonrpc.h>
 * @brief The JsonRpc class manages ConnectionListener and Connection instances,
 * and emits incoming JSON-RPC Messages.
 * @author David C. Lonie
 *
 * To use the JsonRpc class, create one or more ConnectionListener instances
 * and call addConnectionListener(). Connect a slot to messageReceived and
 * handle any incoming messages.
 *
 * This class will handle the following standard JSON-RPC errors:
 *
 * - -32600 Invalid request
 *   - The message type could not be determined.
 * - -32603 Internal error
 *   - Internal JSON-RPC error
 * - -32700 Parse error
 *   - Invalid JSON received, an error occurred during parsing.
 *
 * The remaining standard JSON-RPC error codes should be handled by the
 * application developer when messageReceived:
 *
 * - -32601 Method not found
 *   - Method not supported by application
 * - -32602 Invalid params
 *   - Inappropriate parameters supplied for requested method.
 *
 * Incoming requests with method="internalPing" will be automatically replied
 * to with result="pong". This can be used to test if a server is alive or not.
 * messageReceived will not be emitted in this case.
 *
 * Use Message::generateResponse() and Message::generateErrorResponse() to
 * easily create replies to incoming requests.
