 *
 * OpenWithActionFactory is an abstract subclass of JobActionFactory designed
 * to open job output with an external application.
 *
 * Subclasses should, at minimum, set m_executableName to the name of the
 * external application in the constructor and reimplement isValidForJob.

   * An outline of this function's behavior:
   *
   * -# Check that this->sender() is a QAction
   * -# Extract the list of Job pointers from the sender's QVariant data.
   * -# Set m_executableFilePath using the following methods, until one finds a
   *    file that both exists and is executable:
   *    -# Check QSettings "ActionFactory/OpenWith/path/[executable name]" path
   *       for the last used path.
   *    -# Search the locations in the PATH environment variable for the
   *       executable.
   *    -# Ask the user to specify the location of the executable.
   * -# For each job in the sender's data list:
   *    -# Check that the filename (as determined by Job::outputDirectory() and
   *       Program::outputFilename()) refers to an existing file.
   *       -# If the file does not exist or the job's Program is no longer
   *          valid, ask the user which file in Job::outputDirectory() to open.
   *    -# Call "[m_executableFilePath] [absolute path to output file]" via
   *       QProcess::startDetached().
