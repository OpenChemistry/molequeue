/**
 * @class JobReferenceBase jobreferencebase.h <molequeue/jobreferencebase.h>
 * @brief Base class for lightweight interfaces to JobData objects.
 * @author David C. Lonie
 *
 * JobData objects, owned by JobManager, each contain data pertaining to a
 * specific job running a Program on a Queue. JobData contains several dynamic
 * properties that change during it's lifetime, e.g. Queue id and JobState. To
 * avoid having out-of-date references in the MoleQueue application, subclasses
 * of JobReferenceBase provide a convenient interface for obtaining and
 * modifying job properties.
 *
 * JobReferenceBase validates the pointer to the JobData object it represents by
 * querying the JobManager. The validity of the JobData pointer can be checked
 * with isValid(), which will return false if the JobData has been removed from
 * the JobManager. Subclasses of JobReferenceBase, Job on the Server and
 * JobRequest on the Client, will forward requests to the JobData. Certain
 * methods may cause signals to be emitted from JobManager; these cases will be
 * noted in the method documentation.
